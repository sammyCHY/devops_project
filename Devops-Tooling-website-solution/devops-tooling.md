# Devops Tooling Website Solution

I want to Introduce a set of DevOps tools that will help my team in day to day activities in managing, developing, testing,deploying and monitoring different projects.

The tools I want my team to be able to use are well known and widely used by multiple DevOps teams, so I will introduce a single DevOps Tooling Solution that will consist of:

1. Jenkins - free and open source automation server used to build CI/CD pipelines.

2. Kubernetes - an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling and management.

3. Jfrog Artifactory - Universal Repository Manager supporting all major packaging formats, build tools and CI servers, Artifactory.

4. Rancher - an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage *Docker* and Kubernetes in production.

5. Grafana - a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application.

6. Prometheus - An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.

7. Kibana - Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your **Elasticsearch**  data and navigate the *Elastic Stack.*

### Side Self Study

Read about **Network-attached storage (NAS), Storage Area Network (SAN)** and related protocols like NFS, (s)FTP, SMB, iSCSI. Explore what **Block-level storage** is and how it is used by Cloud Service providers, know the different from **Object storage**. On the **example of AWS service** understand the difference between Block Storage, Object Storage and Network File System 

### Setup and technologies used in Project 7

As a member of a DevOps team, I will implement a tooling website solution which makes access to DevOps tools within the corporate infrastructure easily accessible.

In this project I will implement a solution that consists of following components:

1. Infrastructure: AWS
2. Webserver Linux: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
3. Database Server: Ubuntu 20.04 + MySQL
4. Storage Server: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server
5. Programming Language: PHP
6. Code Repository: **GitHub**
