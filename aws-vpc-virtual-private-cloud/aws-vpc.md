# AWS VPC- Virtual Private Cloud

I will explore the core concept of Amazon Web Services (AWS), focusing specifically on Virtually Private Clouds (VPCs). my objective is to understand the fundamental components of VPC infrastructure, including subnets, gateways, and routing tables. Through practical demonstrations and interactive exercises, I will navigate the AWS management console to deploy and manage these critical components effectively.

# Project Goals:

- Understand the fundamentals of virtual private cloud (vpc) and its components.

- Gain hands-on experience in setting up and configuring vpc, subnets, internet gateway, and vpc peering connections.

- Learn how to enable internet connectivity securely within a vpc. 

- Implement outbound internet access through the NAT gateway.

- Establish direct communication between VPCs using VPC peering.
