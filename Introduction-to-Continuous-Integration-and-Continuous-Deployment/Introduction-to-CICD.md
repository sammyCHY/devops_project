# Introduction to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

The Project will involve setting up a simple web application (e.g., a Node.js application) and applying CI/CD practices using GitHub Actions. This application will have basic functionality, such as serving a static web page.


# Introduction to GitHub Actions and CI/CD Course Project

Introduction course on GitHub Actions and Continous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). This course is designed to provide and hands-on-learning experience, guiding me through the essentials of automating software development processes using GitHub Actions. Whether a developer, a student, or someone curious about CI/CD practices, this course will equip you with the practical skills and knowledge you need to implement these powerful automation techniques in your projects.

# Why is This Relevant for Learners?

For an example, Imagine you're a chef in a busy restaurant. Every dish you prepare is like a piece of software code. Without a systematic approach, you might end up with orders being mixed up, dishes taking too long to prepare, or worse, the quality of the food being inconsistent. This is where a well-organized kitchen, with clear processes and automation (like having appliances that precisely time and cook parts of the dishes), comes into play. In software development, CI/CD is akin to this efficient kitchen. It ensures that your 'dishes'(software builds) are consistently 'cooked'(built, tested, and deployed) with precision and efficiency. By learning GitHub Actions and CI/CD, you're essentially learning how to set up and manage your high-tech kitchen in the software world, allowing you to serve 'dishes' faster, with higher quality, and with fewer 'kitchen mishaps' (bugs and deployment issues).


This course will help me understand and implement these practices, making my software development process more efficient and error-free, much like a well-orchestrated kitchen. Whether you're working on personal projects, contributing to open source, or building enterprise-level applications, mastering CI/CD with GitHub Actions will be an invaluable skill in my development toolkit.

### Lesson 1: Understanding Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

## Objectives:

1. Define CI/CD and understand its benefits.

2. Get familiar with the CI/CD Pipeline.


## Lesson Details:

1. Definition and Benefits of CI/CD:

    - Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

    - Continuous Deployment (CD) is the process of releasing software changes to production automatically and reliably.

    - **Benefits:** Faster release rate, improved developer productivity, better code quality, and enhanced customer satisfaction.


2. Overview of the CI/CD Pipeline:
    

    - **CI Pipeline** typically includes steps like version control, code integration, automated testing, and building the application.

    - **CD Pipeline** involves steps like deploying the application to a staging or production environment, and post-deployment monitoring.

    - **Tools:** Version control systems (e.g., Git), CI/CD platforms (e.g., GitHub Actions), testing frameworks, and deployment tools.

## Lesson Details:

- **GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD Platform integrated into GitHub, automating the build, test, and deployment pipelines of your software directly within my GitHub repository.

- **Documentation Reference:** Explore the [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for in-depth understanding.

### Key Concepts and Terminology:

### 1. Workflow:

-   **Definition:** A configurable automated process made up of one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file in your repository.

- **Example:** A workflow to test and deploy a Node.js application upon a Git Push.

- **Documentation:** Learn more about workflows in the [GitHub Docs on Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows)


### 2. Event:

-   **Definition:** A specific activity that triggers a workflow. Events include activities like push, pull request, issue creation, or even a scheduled time.

-   **Example:** A `Push` event triggers a workflow that runs tests every time code is pushed to any branch in a repository.

-   **Documentation:** Review different types of events in the [Events that trigger workflows section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows)


### 3. Job:

-   Definition: A set of steps in a workflow that are executed on the same runner. Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel.

- **Example:** A job that  runs on your application.

- Documentation: Understand jobs in detail in the [GitHub Docs on Jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does)


### 4. Step:

-   **Definition:** An individual task that can run commands within a job. Steps can run scripts or actions.

-   **Example:** A step in a job to install dependencies (`npm install`).

-   **Documentation:** Learn about steps in the [Steps section of GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps)


5. Action:

-   **Definition:** Standalone commands combined into steps to create a job. Actions can be written by you or provided by the GitHub community.

-   **Example:** Using `actions/checkout` to check out your repository code.


-   Documentation: Explore GitHub Actions in the [Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) and learn how to create your own in the [Creating actions guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations)  



### 6. Runner:

-   **Definition:** A server that runs your workflows when they're triggered. Runners can be hosted by GitHub or self-hosted.

-   Example: A GitHub-hosted runner that uses Ubuntu.

-   **Documentation:** Delve into runners in the [GitHub Docs on](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners)


## Additional Resources:

-   **GitHub Learning Lab:** Interactive courses to learn GitHub Actions. visit [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/courses)

-   **GitHub Actions Quickstart:** For a hands-on introduction, check out the [Quickstart for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart)

# Practical Implementation

### Setting Up the Project:

1. Initialize a GitHub Repository:

    - Create a new repository on GitHub.

![The Image shows the creation of new repository](image/images/new-repository-Github.png)


    - Clone it to your local machine.

![The Image shows the cloning to the local machine](image/images/git-clone-repository.png)

2. Create a Simple Node.js Application:

    - Initialize a Node.js Project (`npm init`).

**Install Node.js and npm**

Before starting, ensure that **Node.js** and **Npm** are installed in my server but before then use the command below to check:

    - Create a simple server using Express.js to serve a static web page.

    - Add your code to the repository and push it to GitHub.

```
// Example: index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
