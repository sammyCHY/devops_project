# Introduction To CICD

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a set of best practices and methodologies that revolutionize the software development lifecycle by enhancing efficiency, reliability, and speed. CI/CD represents a seamless integration of automation and collaboration throughout the development process, aiming to deliver high-quality software consistently and rapidly. In the realm of CI, developers regularly integrated their code changes into a shared repository, triggering automated builds and tests to detect integration issues early. On the other hand, CD encompasses both Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment, ensuring that software is always in a deployable state and automating the deployment process for swift and reliable releases. The CI/CD pipeline fosters a culture of continuous improvement, allowing development, allowing development teams to iterate quickly, reduce manual interventions, and deliver software with confidence.


# What is Jenkins

Jenkins is widely employed as a crucial CI/CD tool for automating software development process. Teams utilize Jenkins to automate building, testing and deploying applications, streamlining the development lifecycle. With Jenkins pipelines, developers can define, version, and execute entire workflows as code, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds. Integration with version control systems allows Jenkins to trigger builds automatically upon code changes, faciliting early detection of issues and enabling teams to deliver high-quality software at a faster pace. Jenkins' flexibility, extensibility through plugins, and support for various tools make it a preferred choice for organizations aiming to implement efficient and automated DevOPs practices.

# Project Pre-requisite

To make the most of this project, learners must have completed foundations Core programs 1 - 3

## Project Goals 

By the end of this Project, learners should have;

- Developed a foundational understanding of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) principles, and articulate their role in improving software development processes.

- Acquired proficiency in using Jenkins by mastering installation,configuration, and navigation through the Jenkins user interface, and gain hands-on experience in creating and managing Jenkins jobs.

- Learned the end-to-end process of automating software builds, runnings automated tests, and deploying applications using Jenkins, fostering a practices in CI/CD processess, including parameterized builds, integration with external tools, and leveraging containerization technologies like Docker.
