# Networking In Kubernetes

Networking refers to the mechanisms and configurations that allow communication between different components (Pods, services and other resources) within a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes provides a flexible and poerful networking model to enable seamless interaction between containers and services, whether they are running on the same node or across different nodes in a cluster.

# Some key aspect of networking in Kubernetes

- **Pod Networking:** Containers within a pod share the same network namespace, allowing them to communicate with each other using localhost. This enables tight coupling between containers within the same pod.

- **Pod-to-Pod Communication:** Pods communicate with each other using their individual IP addresses. Kubernetes ensures that pods can reach other directly, regardless of the node they are running on, by using an overlay network. 

- Ingress: Ingress is a Kubernetes resources that allows external access to services within the cluster. It defines rules for routing external HTTP and HTTPS traffic to different services based on the host or path. Ingress controllers manage the actual routing and traffic flow.
