# The Relevance of This Course for Learners

![The Image shows the relevance on this course for learners](image/images/deployment-pipeline.png)


Imagine you're a pilot of a modern airliner - a complex machine with numerous systems and components that need to work in perfectly harmony. In this analogy, your codebase is the airliner, while GitHub Actions represents the sophisticated control systems that manage the aircraft's operations. Each commit, merge, or push you make is akin to adjusting the flight controls, ensuring that the aircraft navigates smoothly and efficiently to its destination - which,in our case, is the successful deployment of your application.


Deploying applications to the cloud without automation is like flying a plane manually without any advanced navigation systems - It's possible, but prone to errors, inefficiencies, and immense stress. GitHub Actions provides the automation - the autopilot, if you will - ensuring that your deployment processes are as smooth, error-free, and efficient as possible. Through this course, you will learn not just to 'fly the plane', but to engage and trust your autopilot, enabling you to manage your applications' journey from development to production with confidence and precision.

**Lesson 1: Introduction to Deployment Pipelines**

**Objectives:**

   - Define and understanding the stages of a deployment pipeline.

   - Learn about different deployment strategies.


Lesson Details:

1. Defining Deployment Stages:

    - **Development:** Writing and testing code in a local environment.

    - **Integration:** Merging code changes to a shared branch.

    - **Testing:** Running automated tests to ensure code quality.

    - **Staging:** Deploying code to a production-like environment for final testing.

    - **Production:** Releasing the final version of your code to the end-users.

**Understanding Deployment Strategies:**

  - **Blue-Green Deployment:** Running two production environments, only one of which servers end-users at any time.

  - **Canary Releases:** Rolling out changes to a small subset of users before full deployment.

  - **Rolling Deployment:** Gradually replacing instances of the previous version of an application with the new version.


**Lesson 2: Automated Release and Versioning**

**Objectives:**

   - Automate Versioning in the CI/CD process.

   - Create and manage software releases.

Automating Versioning in CI/CD:

1. **Semantic Versioning:**

    - Use semantic versioning (SemVer) for your software. It uses a three-part version number, for example, `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

    - Resources: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)


2. **Automated Versioning with GitHub Actions:**

    - Implement automated versioning using GitHub Actions to increment version numbers automatically based on code changes.


### Example Snippet for a Versioning Script in GitHub Actions:


```
name: Bump version and tag
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    name: Create Tag
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # The checkout action checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.

      - name: Bump version and push tag
        uses: anothrNick/github-tag-action@1.26.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{" secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN "}}
          DEFAULT_BUMP: patch
        # This action automatically increments the patch version and tags the commit.
        # 'DEFAULT_BUMP' specifies the type of version bump (major, minor, patch).
```

- This action will automatically increment the patch version and create a new tag each time changes are pushed to the main branch.


### Creating and Managing Releases:

1. **Automating Releases with GitHub Actions:**

    - Set up GitHub Actions to create a new release whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository.

    **Example snippet to create a release:**

```
    on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build:
    name: Create Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # Checks out the code in the tag that triggered the workflow.

      - name: Create Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{" secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN "}}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{" github.ref "}}
          release_name: Release ${{" github.ref "}}
          # This step creates a new release in GitHub using the tag name.
```


- The `actions/create-release@v1` action is used to create a release on GitHub. It uses the tag that triggered the workflow to name and label the release.


**Troubleshooting and Additional Resources:**

  - For troubleshooting GitHub Actions, the [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is an invaluable resources.

  - To resolve issues related to specific actions used in your workflow, refer to their respective repositories on GitHub or their documentation.

  - For general questions and community support, the [GitHub Community Forum](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/) can be a great place to seek help.


  - Remember, reading through the logs generated by GitHub Actions can provide insights into what might be going wrong with your workflows.


**Lesson 3: Deploying to Cloud Platforms**

**Objectives:**

   - Deploy applications to popular cloud platforms using GitHub Actions

   - Configure deployment environments.

**Lesson Details:**
**Detailed Guide: Deploying Applications to Cloud Platforms with GitHub ACtions**

For beginners completely new to GitHub Actions and cloud deployment, it's essential to understand the process step-by-step. Here's a detailed breakdown of deploying applications to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform using GitHub Actions:


Step 1: Choose a Cloud Platform

   - Decide on a cloud platform based on your project requirements. Each platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) has its own set of services and pricing models.

   - AWS: [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)

   - Azure: [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

   - Google Cloud Platform: [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)


**Step 2: Set Up GitHub Actions for Deployment**

1. Creating the Workflow File:

    - Workflow file are YAML file stored in your repository's `.github/workflows` directory.

    - Start by creating a file, e.g., `deploy-to-aws.yml` in this directory.

2. Defining the Workflow:

    - A workflow is defined with a series of steps that run on specified events.

**Example for AWS Deployment:**

```
name: Deploy to AWS
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # This workflow triggers on a push to the 'main' branch.

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Specifies the runner environment.

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE.

    - name: Set up AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{" secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID "}}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{" secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY "}}
        aws-region: us-west-2
      # Configures AWS credentials from GitHub secrets.

    - name: Deploy to AWS
      run: |
        # Add your deployment script here.
        # For example, using AWS CLI commands to deploy.
```

**Step 3: Configuring Deployment Environments:**

1. Setting Up Environment Variables and Secrets:

    - Store sensitive information like API keys and access tokens as [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) 

    - Use environment variables for non-sensitive configuration.


2. Environment-Specific Workflow:

    - Tailor your workflow for different environments (development, staging, production) by using conditions or different workflow files.
