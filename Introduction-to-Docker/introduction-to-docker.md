# Introduction to Docker

### Introduction to Docker and Containers

### what are Containers?

In realm of software development and deployment, professionals used to face a dilemma. They crafted brilliant code on their local machines, only to find that when deployed to other environments, it sometimes does not work. The culprit? The notorious "it works on my machine" phenomenon.

Get started with Docker, a tool that emerged to a major problem IT industry. A man named Solomon Hykes, who, in 2013, unvailed Docker, a containerisation platform that promised to revolutionize the way IT professionals built, shipped, and ran applications.

Imagine containers as magical vessels that encapsulates everything an application needs to run smoothly - its code, libraries, dependencies, and even a dash of configuration magic. These containers ensure that an application remains consistent and behaves the same, whether it's running on a developer's laptop, a testing server, or a live production environment. Docker had bestowed upon IT professionals the power to say goodbye to the days of "it works on my machine."

As a learner, I have to find myself at the crossroads of this digital fairytale. why, you may wonder, should you embark on this journey into the world of Docker? Fear not, for the answer lies in the immense benefits that Docker bestows upon its disciples. Moreover, Docker simplifies the deployment process, making it as easy as waving a wand. Gone are the days of wrestling with complex installation procedures and compatibility issues. Docker containers provide a standardized, portable environment, ensuring that my applications run seamlessly across various platforms.

So, as you embark on this adventure into Docker, envision yourself as a modern-day sorcerer, wielding the power to conjure applications that dance gracefully from development to deployment.

Advantages of Conatiners

- ***Portability Across Different Environments:***In the past, deploying applications was akin to navigating a treacherous maze, with compatibility issues lurking at every turn. Docker's containers, however, encapsulate the entire application along with its dependencies and configurations. This magical package ensures that my creation dances gracefully across different platforms, sparing you from the woes of the "it works on my machine" curse. With Docker, bid farewell to the headaches of environment mismatches and embrace a world where your application reigns supreme, irrespective of its hosting kingdom.

- Resources Efficiency Compared to Virtual Machines: Docker containers share the underlying host's operating system kernel, making them lightweight and nimble. This efficiency allows me to run multiple containers on a single host without the extravagant resource demands of traditional virtual machines. Picture Docker containers as magical carriages, swiftly transporting my applications without burdening the kingdom with unnecessary excess. With Docker, revel in the harmony of resource optimization and application efficiency.

- **Rapid Application Deployment and Scaling:** Docker containers can be effortlessly spun up or torn down, facilitating the swift deploment of applications. Whether you're facing a sudden surge in demand or orchestrating a grand-scale production, Docker allows you to scale my applications seamlessly. Imagine commanding an army of containers to conquer the peaks of user demand, only to gracefully retreat when the storm has passed. With Docker, the ability to scale becomes a wand in my hand, transforming the challenges of deployment into a choreographed ballet of efficiency.

Comparison of Docker Container with Virtual Machines

Docker and Virtual machines (VMs) are both technologies used for application deployment, but they differ in their approach to virtualization. Virtual machines emulate entire operating systems, resulting in higher resource overhead and slower performance. In contrast, Docker utilizes containerization, encapsulating applications and their dependencies while sharing the host OS's kernel. This lightweight approach reduces resource consumption, provides faster startup times, and ensures portability across different environments. Docker's emphasis on microservices and standardized packaging fosters scalability and efficiency, making it a preferred choice for modern, agile application development, whereas virtual machines excel in scenarios requiring stronger isolation but at the cost of increase resource usage. The choice between Docker and VMs depends on specific use cases and the desired balance between performance and isolation.

## Importance of Docker

- **Technology and Industry Impact:** The significance of Docker in the technology landscape cannot be overstated. Docker and containerization have revolutionized software development, deployment, and management. The ability to package applicationd and their dependencies into lightweight, portable conatainers addresses key challenges in software development, such as consistency across different environments and efficient resource utilization.

- **Real-World Impact:** Implementing Docker brings tangible benefits to organizations. It streamlines the development process, promotes collaboration between development and operations teams, and accelerates the delivery of applications Docker's containerization technology enhances scalability, facilitates rapid deployment, and ensures the consistency of applications across diverse environments. This not only saves time and resources but also contributes to a more resilient and agile software development lifecycle.

# Getting Started With Docker

### Installing Docker.
We need to launch an ubuntu 20.04LTS instance and connect to it, then follow the steps below.

Before installing Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, it is necessary to configure the Docker repository. Following this setup, we can proceed to install and update Docker directly from the repository.

Now let's first add docker's official GPC key

learn more about [GPG KEYS](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto)

```
sudo apt-get update
```
This a Linux command that refreshes the package list on a Debain-based system, ensuring the latest software information is available for installation.

```ll/ubuntu/
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
```
This a Linux command that installs essential packages including certificate authorities, a data tranfer tool (curl), and the GNU privacy Guard for secure communication and package verfication.

```
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
```
The command above creates a directory (/etc/apt/keyrings) with specific permissions (0755) for storing keyring files, which are used for docker's authentication.

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```
This downloads the Docker GPG key using `curl`

```
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```
Sets read permissions for all users on the Docker GPG key file within the APT keyring directory.

**Let's add the repository to Apt sources**

```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
