# 5 Essential Skills to Elevate my shell Scripting Journey into Cloud Computing.

As I embark on the next phase of the journey into tech, getting my feet strong in shell scripting is one the most important, and foundational skills I must not miss. The skills and concepts I v'e mastered so far have laid the groundwork for what comes next. However, the journey ahead is not just a continuation-it's a leap towards achieving great success in the realms of Cloud, DevOps, System Engineering, and related fields. The areas we are about to explore are not merely topics; they are the keys to unlocking profound capabilities in automation, problem-solving, and innovation in the digital world.

**Objective**

Our objective for the next series of projects is to advance my shell scripting skills while also integrating and utilizing cloud services. By focusing on the following 5 critical concepts, I aim to elevate my capabilities to a level where I can confidently navigate and harness the power of both shell scripting and cloud computing. This combination is not just about learning commands and services; It's about understanding how to leverage these tools in unison to build, deploy, and manage scalable, efficient, and robust systems in the cloud.

1. Functions

2. Arrays

3. Environment Variables

4. Command Line Arguments

5. Error Handling

Delivering the shell script based on a real world requirement.

**Background:**

***Datawise Solutions*** is a forward-thinking Data Science Consulting Company that specializes in deploying analytical and machine learning environments to support data-driven decision-making for its clients. Recognizing the need for agility and efficiency in setting up such environments, Datawise has decided to streamline its deployment process on AWS, focusing on simplicity and automation.

**Scenario:**

One of Datawise solutions'clients, a burgeoning e-commerce startup, is looking to harness the power of data science to analyze customer behavior and enhance their data science workspace on AWS, utilizing EC2 instance for computational tasks and s3 buckets for storing their vast database 
of customer interactions.

***Specific Requirements:***

To meet the client's needs and ensure a practical learning experince, DataWise Solutions plans to develop a script that automates the setup of EC2 instances and s3 buckets. This script will incorporate the 5 critical shell scripting concepts previously identified:

1. ***Functions:*** Implements custom functions to modularize tasks like creating EC2 instances, configuring s3 buckets, and verifying deployment statuses.

2. ***Arrays:*** Use arrays to manage a list of resources created, ensuring easy tracking and manipulation.

3. ***Environment Variables:*** Leverage environment variables to store sensitive information like AWS credentials, region settings, and configuration parameters, enhancing script portability and security.

4. ***Command Line Arguments:*** Accept command line arguments to customize the script's behaviour, such as specifying the EC2 instance type or S3 bucket name, allowing for dynamic and flexible deployments.


5. ***Error Handling:*** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to catch and respond to AWS service exceptions, ensuring the script can recover gracefully from failures.

The purpose of this project is to ensure that I understand the requirement. My understanding doesn't have to be perfect at this stage. In teh next project, I will begin proper implementation.

My submission for this mini project should be to explain what I think the requirement is.
