# 1. Linux
## Introduction to Linux
Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is widely used in various computing devices, from servers and supercomputers to smartphones and embedded systems. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for both individual users and enterprises.

### Here are some of the brief introduction to what ***Linux*** is all about.

### Open Source Nature: 
Linux is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which means its source code is freely available to anyone. This fosters a community-driven development model where developers worldwide can contribute to its improvement.

### Kernel: 
At its core, Linux comprises the kernel, which manages hardware resources, such as memory, CPU, and peripheral devices. The kernel interacts with user applications and system utilities to provide a complete operating environment.

### Distributions (Distros): 
Linux is not just one operating system but rather a family of operating systems, or distributions (distros), each tailored for specific purposes or user preferences. Popular distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, and Arch Linux.

### Command Line Interface (CLI): 
While Linux distributions typically offer graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the command line interface (CLI) remains a powerful and efficient way to interact with the system. The shell, such as Bash (Bourne Again Shell), is the primary interface for executing commands, managing files, and automating tasks.

### Package Management: 
Linux distributions employ package managers to simplify the installation, update, and removal of software packages. Package formats vary between distributions (e.g., DEB for Debian-based systems, RPM for Red Hat-based systems), but the concept remains consistent across most distros.

### File System Hierarchy: 
Linux follows a hierarchical file system structure, with directories organized in a tree-like fashion. Common directories include /bin (essential system binaries), /etc (system configuration files), /home (user home directories), and /var (variable data such as logs and temporary files).

### Multi-User and Multi-Tasking: Linux is inherently designed to support multiple users simultaneously, allowing several users to log in and run processes concurrently. It also supports multitasking, enabling multiple programs to run simultaneously on the system.

### Security: 
Linux is renowned for its robust security features, including user and group permissions, access control lists (ACLs), and robust firewall configurations. Regular security updates are provided by distribution maintainers to address vulnerabilities and enhance system security.

### Networking: 
Linux includes extensive networking capabilities, making it a popular choice for servers and networking devices. It supports various networking protocols, services (such as DHCP, DNS, and FTP), and utilities for network configuration and troubleshooting.

### Customizability and Flexibility:
One of Linux's greatest strengths is its flexibility and customizability. Users can tailor their Linux systems to meet specific requirements, choosing from a vast array of software packages, desktop environments, and system configurations.

**Learning Linux can be a rewarding journey, offering valuable skills in system administration, software development, and cybersecurity. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, Linux provides a powerful platform for exploration, innovation, and collaboration**.

  # FILE MANIPULATION
## 1. sudo command: 
The **sudo** command in Linux allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified in the sudoers configuration file. The word "**sudo**" stands for "superuser do."

The commands on the images below are for **sudo**
![the image below is a screenshot of sudo command](images/apt-get.png)

The second command is an option on how to use **sudo**
![the image below is a screenshot of sudo command](images/image/sudoo.png)

## 2. pwd:
pwd stands for **"print working directory."** When you run the pwd command, it displays the current working directory, which is the directory in the file system where you are currently located or "working."

Here's how you use it:

/home/ubuntu/

![The image below shows the pwd command](images/image/pwd1.png)

![The image below shows the pwd command](images/image/pwd.png)


## 3. cd command: 
The cd command in the command line stands for "change directory." It is used to change the current working directory in the shell.

Here's how you typically use it:

cd [directory]
For example, to change to a directory named "Documents," you would type:
**cd Documents**

![here's is the image indicating cd command](images/image/cd.png)


## 4. ls command:
The **ls command** is used to list files and directories in a directory. It's one of the most commonly used commands in the command line interface.

Here's the basic syntax:

ls [options] [directory]     ls /path/to/directory

![The image below show ls command](images/image/ls.png)

![The image below show ls command](images/image/ls_flags.png)


## 5. cat command:
The **cat command** short for "concatenate" and is primarily used to display the contents of files. It's one of the fundamental commands in the command line interface.

Here's the basic syntax:

cat [options] [file(s)]  or   cat file1.txt file2.txt

![The image below show cat command](images/image/cat.png)

## 6. cp command:
The **"cp command"** is used to copy files and directories. It stands for "copy."

Here's the basic syntax:

cp [options] source destination
source: Specifies the file or directory you want to copy.
destination: Specifies the target location where you want to copy the file or directory.
If you're copying a single file, you would use cp like this:
 
For example, to copy a file named file1.txt to a directory named backup, you would use:

cp file1.txt backup/
If you're copying multiple files, you can specify them one after the other, followed by the destination directory. For example:

cp file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt backup/

![The image below show cp command](images/image/cp.png)


## 7. mv command:
The mv command is used to move files or directories from one location to another. It can also be used to rename files or directories.

Here's the basic syntax:
mv [options] source destination
source: Specifies the file or directory you want to move or rename.
destination: Specifies the target location where you want to move the file or directory, or the new name if you're renaming.
If you're moving a single file, you would use mv like this:

mv sourcefile destination
For example, to move a file named file1.txt to a directory named backup, you would use:

mv file1.txt backup/
If you're moving multiple files, you can specify them one after the other, followed by the destination directory. For example:


![The image below show mv command](images/image/mv.png)

## 8. mkdir command:
The **mkdir command** is used to create directories (folders). It stands for "make directory."

- Here's the basic syntax:

- mkdir [options] directory_name

![The image below show mkdir command](images/image/mkdir.png)

## 9. rmdir command:
The **rmdir command** is used to remove empty directories (folders). It stands for "remove directory."

- Here's the basic syntax:

- rmdir [options] directory_name
  
![The image below show rmdir command](images/image/rmdir.png)


## 10. rm command:
The rm command in Linux and Unix-like operating systems is used to remove files or directories. It stands for "remove."

Here's the basic syntax:

rm [options] file(s) or directory(s)

![The image below show rm command](images/image/rm.png)


## 11. touch command:
The **touch command** is used to create empty files and update the timestamps of existing files. Its primary purpose is to change the access and modification timestamps of files, but if a file doesn't exist, touch will create it.

Here's the basic syntax:
touch [options] file(s)

![The image below show touch command](images/image/touch.png)


## 12. locate command:
The **locate command** is used to quickly search for files and directories in the file system based on their names. It's a fast and efficient way to find files, especially when you know the name or part of the name but not the exact location.

Here's the basic syntax:
locate [options] pattern

![The image below show locate command](images/image/locate.png)


## 13. find command:
The find command in Linux and Unix-like operating systems is a powerful tool for searching and locating files and directories in a file system hierarchy. It allows you to search for files based on various criteria such as name, type, size, permissions, and more.

Here's the basic syntax:

bash
Copy code
find [options] [starting_directory] [expression]
