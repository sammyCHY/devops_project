# 1. Linux
## Introduction to Linux
Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is widely used in various computing devices, from servers and supercomputers to smartphones and embedded systems. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for both individual users and enterprises.

### Here are some of the brief introduction to what ***Linux*** is all about.

### Open Source Nature: 
Linux is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which means its source code is freely available to anyone. This fosters a community-driven development model where developers worldwide can contribute to its improvement.

### Kernel: 
At its core, Linux comprises the kernel, which manages hardware resources, such as memory, CPU, and peripheral devices. The kernel interacts with user applications and system utilities to provide a complete operating environment.

### Distributions (Distros): 
Linux is not just one operating system but rather a family of operating systems, or distributions (distros), each tailored for specific purposes or user preferences. Popular distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, and Arch Linux.

### Command Line Interface (CLI): 
While Linux distributions typically offer graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the command line interface (CLI) remains a powerful and efficient way to interact with the system. The shell, such as Bash (Bourne Again Shell), is the primary interface for executing commands, managing files, and automating tasks.

### Package Management: 
Linux distributions employ package managers to simplify the installation, update, and removal of software packages. Package formats vary between distributions (e.g., DEB for Debian-based systems, RPM for Red Hat-based systems), but the concept remains consistent across most distros.

### File System Hierarchy: 
Linux follows a hierarchical file system structure, with directories organized in a tree-like fashion. Common directories include /bin (essential system binaries), /etc (system configuration files), /home (user home directories), and /var (variable data such as logs and temporary files).

### Multi-User and Multi-Tasking: Linux is inherently designed to support multiple users simultaneously, allowing several users to log in and run processes concurrently. It also supports multitasking, enabling multiple programs to run simultaneously on the system.

### Security: 
Linux is renowned for its robust security features, including user and group permissions, access control lists (ACLs), and robust firewall configurations. Regular security updates are provided by distribution maintainers to address vulnerabilities and enhance system security.

### Networking: 
Linux includes extensive networking capabilities, making it a popular choice for servers and networking devices. It supports various networking protocols, services (such as DHCP, DNS, and FTP), and utilities for network configuration and troubleshooting.

### Customizability and Flexibility:
One of Linux's greatest strengths is its flexibility and customizability. Users can tailor their Linux systems to meet specific requirements, choosing from a vast array of software packages, desktop environments, and system configurations.

**Learning Linux can be a rewarding journey, offering valuable skills in system administration, software development, and cybersecurity. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, Linux provides a powerful platform for exploration, innovation, and collaboration**.

  # FILE MANIPULATION
## 1. sudo command: 
The **sudo** command in Linux allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified in the sudoers configuration file. The word "**sudo**" stands for "superuser do."
